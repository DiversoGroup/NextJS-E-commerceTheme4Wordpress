## Why create a wordpress theme with Next.js?

## How does Next.js works as frontend of a Wordpress platform?


In a project, WordPress is used as a **headless or decoupled CMS**, just for managing the content. Next.js uses data from graphQl to dynamicaly render the data in the DOM with React.

With Next.js you'll still use your WordPress dashboard to edit and create content in exactly the same way that you are accustomed to. As you make changes content is automatically updated in your Next.js client, just as it is when using a traditional WordPress theme.

### » It's extensible like WordPress

Frontend with Next.js powers a very flexible extensibility pattern similar to that of WordPress itself

### » It's rendered dynamically

In Next.js the HTML is rendered dynamically by a Node.js server or a serverless service. This means the HTML does not have to be rebuilt each time the content is edited or new content is published.

Because of its dynamic approach, Next.js provides a great power and reliability when it comes to frequent and real-time content updates, making it a great fit for those projects with content that might change rapidly or that is expected to grow over time.
